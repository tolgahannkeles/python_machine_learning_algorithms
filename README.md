# Machine Learning Models Repository ü§ñ

Welcome to my machine learning models repository! This repository contains Python implementations of various machine learning models.

## Overview üìã

This project aims to provide a collection of machine learning models implemented in Python. Each model is designed to showcase different algorithms and techniques commonly used in the field of machine learning. Whether you are a beginner looking to explore the basics or an experienced practitioner seeking reference implementations, this repository has something for everyone.

## Models Included üöÄ

1. **Linear Regression:** Simple linear regression model to predict numerical values based on input features.
2. **Logistic Regression:** Binary classification model for predicting the probability of an event.
3. **Decision Trees:** Implementation of decision tree classifiers for both classification and regression tasks.
4. **Random Forest:** Ensemble model combining multiple decision trees for improved accuracy and robustness.
5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** A simple yet powerful algorithm for classification and regression.
6. **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** Linear and non-linear SVM implementations for classification tasks.
7. **K-Means Clustering:** Unsupervised learning algorithm for clustering similar data points.

## More Models üîç

Explore the models by navigating to each model's respective directory. As of now, there are 7 models included in this repository. The number of models may increase in the future as I continue to update the repository.
